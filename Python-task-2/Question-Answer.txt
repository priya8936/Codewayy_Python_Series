Q1 Why is list used?
A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, 
ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. 
Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes,Commas separate the elements that are contained within a list 
lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].

Q2 How do lists and sets differ ?
Just like dictionaries, sets have no order in their collection of items. Not like lists.
Set requires the items contained in it to be hashable, lists store non-hashable items.
Sets require your items to be unique and immutable. Duplicates are not allowed in sets, 
while lists allow for duplicates and are mutable.

Q3 Application of dictionaries with real world example.
-You can use a dictionary as a jump table to emulate a switch type statement.
-You can use a dictionary to easily count the content of a list.
-You can use a dictionary to build indexes of content.
-You can use it in unit tests, sample data for web forms.
